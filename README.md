# Ali Trip Planning App

This is my Android assignment.  

It allows the user to:

- Login, and save login using SharedPreferences
- Add new trips
- Edit existing trips
- Search trips
- View trip details in a list (RecyclerView)

The app uses SharedPreferences for local storage, DatePicker for selecting dates, and different views like Radio buttons.  
It is a simple project to practice Android development basics.
